# Vanguard Toggler
Enables and disables vanguard at will.

Simple app I wrote in 10 minutes that disables or enables vanguard.

Once you open it, it will toggle vanguard(it will be disabled if enabled and vice versa), this action requires a restart.

It renames vgk.sys to vgk1.sys so the anti-cheat system doesn't run at boot, if you want to play Valorant you must enable vanguard.
